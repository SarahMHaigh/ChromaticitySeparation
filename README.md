# Chromaticity Separation

Requirements: everything runs in MATLAB. Stimulus presentation scripts need Psychtoolbox. EEG analyses need EEGLAB and ERPLAB. All of these toolboxes are free to download.

## ERPs in migraine to color:

Studies investigating the neural response to colors that vary in their CIE UCS chromaticity separation.

- The code used to present stimuli that vary in their chromaticity separation to generate ERPs: ColourDiffERP_migraine.m 

- Stimuli associated: 2019stimuli.zip

- EEG analysis script: ColourERPanalysis.m

- Due to the adjusted EEG montage for the high-density cap, the .elp is attached: HD_EEG_elec_locations.elp

## SSVEPs to color during a task:

Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to chromatic gratings that vary in their CIE UCS chromaticity separation. The code and stimuli used are all in Lindquist2020.zip. The screen used had particularly high luminance for the green pixels. Alternates gratings with a grey screen at 5Hz while letters presented in the center of the screen (for the CPT) changed at 3Hz.
